#Description 
In this application anyone can share video link, article link like medium if they find that it will help other in solving their basic and advance tech reletaed quries.
So all the links are divided in different differnet categories.

The article posted by any user can modified and deleted only by that user, Admin has access to all the link in DB , and all the link can be modified and delketed by admin.

I have also documented the article which are asked in interview.

This application is build with NextJS for frontend and NodeJS for backend.
I have used amazon SES[Simple email service] for email registration process,
S3 is used to store the image link.

Frontend is hosted on Netlify,
Backend is hosted on Horeku.
